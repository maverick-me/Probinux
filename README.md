# Probinux

Probinux is a tool that looks for possible unreliable processes on your system by running checks against a dictionary. Probinux makes use of AES-128 to keep the dictionary secure.


+Probinux is easily configurable

+User can add/delete any processes from reliable list

+Size on disk is very small


-AES has padding problems, encryption after decryption might be problematic

-There is no good way of finding all the reliable processes and making a list

-Manual updation and good knowledge of Linux processes is required
